# **INTRO**

Lapex Resourse Pack is used for the Lapex project that I started.

This includes textures, shaders, fonts, and some more

This is basically apex legends in Minecraft

If you want to use this on your server, do it!

Make sure you installed denizen and got the script from my another repository.
